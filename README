An online read-along book application for children.

This project is using :
- Playframework (Java)
- JQuery
- Less.css
- Google App Engine

Ideas :
- Book library : page where the books will be listed
- Crossbrowser / Tablets / Smartphones
	- It think the best way to deal with those devices would be to use Media Queries : http://mediaqueri.es
- Fallback for old browsers : some effects / features will have to be removed
- Pageflip visual effect using JS / HTML5
- Caching book pages / pre-caching book pages before they have been requested
	- The Caching function will start downloading other pages starting from the current page
	- e.g.: if the current page is 8 the application will start downloading pages in this order : 9 7 10 6 11 5 12 4 13 3 14 2 15 1 16 17.
- Printing / Export Page or book to PDF / Download.
- Url update : the url will be updated as the user turn pages : that will allow him to copy / paste / bookmark
- The user should be able to turn pages using the cross arrows of his keyboard
